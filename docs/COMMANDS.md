# Commands

To start the tool after installation it is (DONT use the inverted commas, these were purely used on GitHub to highlight where to put the target IP):

```bash
p-scan "insert target ip address"
```
If the user wanted to do a scan but with Verbose mode, the following command would be:

```bash
p-scan "insert target ip address" -v
```

Below I have attached a screenshot of the help menu of all the different commands the user can execute.
